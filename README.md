# Introduction

This project is a small setup for testing Ansible locally using Vagrant. The Vagrantfile launches two Vagrant-boxes, one for Ansible and one for Ansible to control.

# Usage

The setup was created in Windows 7. Clone the project to your local drive and change the username {{username}} to your correct username.

If you have [putty](http://www.putty.org/) on your PATH you can use the Launch-Vagrant-Ansible-Putty.cmd file. It will launch putty for the Ansible server when Vagrant is up and running.
